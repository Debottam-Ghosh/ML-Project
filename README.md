## 🚀 Workflow

1. **Data Collection** – Loaded data from [mention source, e.g., CSV, database, API].
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Uncovered patterns, trends, and insights.
3. **Data Preprocessing** – Handled missing values, categorical encoding, scaling, etc.
4. **Feature Engineering** – Created and selected the most informative features.
5. **Model Training** – Trained multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
6. **Evaluation** – Compared model performance using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
7. **Model Tuning** – Used GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
8. **Final Model** – Saved the best-performing model for deployment.
